# hello-world
First repository for learning purposes
Alright. Been coding with Python as a hobby for a few years. Went through some courses on Coursera and haven't retained much.

Now doing a Udemy course with Unity3d as the focus and am aiming to keep this knowledge active.

My long term goals are to publish a game before end of next year (April 2018). Be renting an office space in my downtown (small town) as a studio in five years.
In ten years, I want to have a stand alone building with a team of artists, developers, and designers.
